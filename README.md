## Abstract

This paper presents a makeover of the psychrometric chart using a new color-shading  method  that  allows  the  whole  chart  to  be  considered  comfortablebased on the variation of non-air related comfort parameters such as meanradiant temperature,  air movement,  and the transitional behavior of occu-pants.  These representations allow forthinking outside the thermal comfortboxwith the use of innovative system types and comfort feedback for occu-pants.  The new chart representations are then applied on several real-worldscenario data-sets to illustrate the value in practice.  An open-source repos-itory  is  available  for  other  researchers  to  reproduce  the  charts  and  color-shading for their own projects using Python and the matplotlib visualizationlibrary.
