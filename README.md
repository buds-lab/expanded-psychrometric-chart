## Abstract

The psychrometric chart is the most indispensable data visualization technique for the designers of comfort systems world-wide. From its humble roots as means of expressing the characteristics of air in system design, the use of the chart has grown to include the representation of the zones of human thermal comfort according to both conventional and adaptive models. In this paper, we present an extensive history of this development and the fallacies with representing comfort as \emph{simply a box} that sometimes moves on the chart. We present a makeover of the old psychrometric chart using a new color-shading method that allows the whole chart to be considered comfortable based on the variation of non-air related comfort parameters such as mean radiant temperature, air movement, and the transitional behavior of occupants. These representations allow for \emph{thinking outside the thermal comfort box} with the use of innovative system types and comfort feedback for occupants. The new chart representations are then applied on several real-world scenario data-sets to illustrate the value in practice. An open-source repository is available for other researchers to reproduce the charts and color-shading for their own projects using Python and the matplotlib visualization library.
